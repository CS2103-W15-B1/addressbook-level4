== Introduction

=== What is Rubrika?

Welcome to Rubrika! +

Rubrika is a desktop Address Book application that lets you store and manage your contacts in a convenient manner.

Rubrika revolutionises the way you interact with an Address Book Application. We have done away with the traditional buttons, and now allow users to interact through the Command Line Interface.

This guide will familiarise you with the basic commands that you will need to start using Rubrika.


== Quick Start

Before we start, please make sure you follow the steps below to install Rubrika.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
If you are missing Java 8, you may download it for free [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here]]

+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#Features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== What's New in Version 1.2

=== Enhanced Autocomplete

Autocomplete should now be able to autocomplete person data as well, based on the information current stored in the application.

=== FindTag

Finds all persons whose tags contain any of the specified tags (not case-sensitive) and displays them as a list with index numbers. +
Format: `findtag TAG [MORE_TAGS]...`

Example: `findtag friends family` +
Searches for all persons containing `friends` tag or `family` tag.

=== Enhanced RemoveTag command

Now, you can specify which person you want to remove the tag from and not just remove from everyone on the list.

There must be a prefix (`n/` or `p/`) present in order to use this autocomplete feature, and you can only use autocomplete at the end of your command input.

Examples:

* `c` becomes `clear` after pressing `Tab` once
* nothing happens to `b` (no command starting with letter `b`)
* `h` becomes `history`, and then `help` if you press `Tab` again
* `add n/J` becomes `add n/John Hawkins` if you have a person with the name `John Hawkins` stored
* `edit 2 t/co t/owesMoney` does not autocomplete the `t/co` because it is in the middle of the input
* `find G` does not autocomplete because there is no prefix present
// end::autocomplete[]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Address Book folder. Alternatively, you may export your contacts into a vCard file and transfer the file to the other Computer and import the vCard file from there.
